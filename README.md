# Prestige
A start to a 2D platformer. 
This is the first project I've started in Unity. I used this to learn about particle systems, camera movement, player movement, animation, enemy hit boxes and colliders.
All art assets are made by me. The player is made using frame by frame animation, and the enemy is animated using built in unity functions. 

How to play: 
Use WASD to move and jump
Spacebar to attack 
Hold i to switch to butterfly 

butterfly can move and attack differently than main character body. However, I never finished the artwork
